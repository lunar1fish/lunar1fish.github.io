<h1><span style="color: #c476db;">About Me!</span></h1>
<h3><span style="color: #bcf5eb;">Q: Who are you?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #5678f5;">A: I'm a high schooler who likes playing instruments! I play clarinet and tenor saxophone, and I'm also an aspiring drum major. (fingers crossed!)</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #bcf5eb;">Q: How long have you been playing?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #5678f5;">A: I've been playing saxophone in general for over 5 years now; crazy how time flies like that! And I've been playing clarinet for about 3 years now, yet somehow it's my better instrument.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #bcf5eb;">Q: What else would you want to play?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #5678f5;">A: All the woodwinds! Maybe starting with Eb Clarinet, and slowly expanding my reach. One day I'll be strong enough to play flute! I'm also hoping to be able to pick up percussion as well.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #bcf5eb;">Q: What else do you do?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #5678f5;">A: Honestly just whatever I feel like, but a lot of video games; I've been doing a LOT of modded Minecraft recently, and it's been fun suffering through Modern Industrialization.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #bcf5eb;">Q: What's the point of this site?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #5678f5;">A: Helping push myself to practice daily! It's definitely something I need to improve on and so this will hopefully help me practice more often.&nbsp;</span></p>
