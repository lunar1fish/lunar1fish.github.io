<p>Bunch of new music to sight read so today's practice video is the easiest one: Sleigh Ride! Or as I like to call it, "Slay Ride". First time I get to be in a full orchestra too so that's quite fun.<br />I'll eventually get around to the other stuff, it's just that... I have more "important" things to get to.&nbsp;</p>
